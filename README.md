# Udacity Deep Learning Projects

## Project 1
In this project, I built a neural network that predicts bike sharing rides for a Bike shop, or how many bikes the Bike shop may need based on the amount of expected customers in a certain month. This project allowed me to use the concepts learned up to this point such as, gradient descent and backpropagation.
