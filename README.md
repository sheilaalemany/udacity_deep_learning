# Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree Projects

### Project 1
In this project, I built a simple neural network from scratch that predicts bike sharing rides for a Bike shop, or how many bikes the Bike shop may need based on the amount of expected customers in a certain month. This project allowed me to use the concepts learned up to this point, such as gradient descent and backpropagation.

### Project 2
In this project, I classified images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. I used a convolutional neural network to classify images of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. This project allowed me to learn about convolutional neural networks, max pooling, dropout, and fully connected layers.
 
### Project 3 
In this project, I generated Simpsons TV scripts using a recurrent neural network using a dataset that contained the scripts from 27 seasons of the Simpsons. This project allowed me to learn about recurrent neural networks using LSTM cells.

### Project 4
In this project, I translated sentences from English to French using a sequence to sequence recurrent neural network. The model was trained on English to French. Project 3 and 4 allowed me to practice text preprocessing including methods to encode, decode, tokenize, and pad.

### Project 5
In this project, I generated images of human faces using a generative adversarial neural network. The model was trained using two datasets, MNIST and CelebA. The MNIST dataset is used to first to train and test the model as it is a simple dataset containing handwritten digits. The CelebA dataset contains over 200,000 celebrity images with annotations. This project allowed me to learn about generative adversarial neural networks containing a discriminator neural network and generator.
